INTRODUCTION:
▪ React is a popular Javascript library used for building user interfaces (Uls) in web applications. React is widely used in web development due to its fast rendering capabilities and ability to handle complex UI components

Ul for Reacs refers to the visual interface of the web application built using React. UI for React is created using a combination of HTML, CSS. and JavaScrips.React provides developersReact (known as react.js) is a free and open for frontend 
JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on 
components.
▪ It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual 
developers and companies.
▪ React can be used as a base in the development of single-page, 
mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like 
Next.js
▪ ReactJS provides minimal and solid feature set to kick-start a web 
application.
▪ It can be used to develop small applications as well as big, 
complex applications.
▪ The main objective of ReactJS is to develop User Interfaces (UI) 
that improves the speed of the apps. It uses virtual DOM 
(JavaScript object), which improves the performance of the app. 
The JavaScript virtual DOM is faster than the regular DOM.
▪ In React, you develop your applications by creating reusable 
components that you can think of as independent Lego blocks. 
These components are individual pieces of a final interface, 
which, when assembled, form the application’s entire user 
interface.

HISTORY:
▪ React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at 
Meta, who released an early prototype of React called "FaxJS".
▪ He was influenced by XHP, an HTML component library for 
PHP. It was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 
and later on Instagram in 2012.

▪ It is backed by a strong community.
LIMITATIONS:
▪ ReactJS components are difficult to reuse in complex 
interactive web projects.
▪ ReactJS’s Virtual DOM algorithm is time-consuming and 
imprecise.
▪ ReactJS’s HTML templates are neither complete nor 
powerful.
▪ ReactJS requires complicated asynchronous programming 
while communicating with the server.
